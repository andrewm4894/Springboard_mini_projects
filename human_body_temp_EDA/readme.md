# Human Body Temperature Exploratory Data Analysis

The purpose of this assignment is to gain practice in using the statistical methods taught in this class. To complement my existing skill set, I chose to complete this assignment using R, rather than Python. In part, I wished to demonstrate the ease of completing many of the assignments tasks in R, relative to Python.

Results are stored in the 'Scheinert Human Body Temperature EDA using R' IPyNotebook. Open using Jupyter Notebooks.
