downloading the notebook in order to read and review it.

The provided dataset includes data on how an applicant's name on their resume sounds, whether it sounds white or sounds African American.
The dataset also indicates whether or not an applicant received a callback following submitting that resume. The included IPyNotebook
contains the details of my analysis. I use a contingency table and a $X$-squared test to show that there is a relationship between how
one's name sounds on their resume and receiving a callback from the prospective employer.
