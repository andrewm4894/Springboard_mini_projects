# Springboard Exploratory Data Analysis Exercise 3: Hospital Readmissions

Note: The IPyNotebook is not displaying correctly in a browser. Options are being reviewed to address this issue. For now, I recommend
downloading the notebook in order to read and review it.

The assignment asked for an assessment of an existing statistical analysis. This analysis was flawed by failing to show the effect size
of a hypothesized relationship between hospital discharges and a facility's excess readmission ratio. The initial analysis used a single
scatter plot to assert that as dicharges rose, excess readmission fell. Further analysis shows that this is a true effect, but that the
size of the effect is too small to substantively relevant.

Full analysis and output is included in the 'Scheinert Hospital Readmits EDA' IPyNotebook. Open using Jupyter Notebook. All analysis is
annotated in the notebook.
