The assignment includes code and output for the the assignment's four exercises

1. 10 Countries with the lowest infant mortality
* Data are extracted from the XML and transformed into a pandas data frame
* The data frame and data types in the data frame are reviewed to confirm a properly-constructed data frame
* The data frame is sorted and viewed to display the targetted data

2. 10 Cities with the largest population
* Data are again extracted and formed into a data frame
* The data frame is again sorted and the 10 most populous cities displayed

3. 10 Most populous ethnicities
* Data are extracted and formed into a data frame with country-ethnic group as the unit of analysis
* Data are grouped to create a new data frame with ethnic groups as the unit of analysis and populations summed
* In the same line of code, this new data frame is sorted and the 10 most populous ethnic groups displayed
    with their population

4. Longest River, Largest Lake, and Highest Airport
* For each item, river, lake, and airport, the data are reviewed and the appropriate item stored with its data
   (length, area, or elevation) and country in a list
* The list is used to generate a list of the countries that a river crosses or which the lake resides
* For the airport, the country is appended to the airport's own list instead of getting a separate list
* Finally, statements are printed indicating the longest river, largest lake, and highest airport
